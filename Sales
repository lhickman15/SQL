#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.
Data tables and questions were given. 

--How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderID)
    from jansales;
    
--How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(Product)
    from jansales
        where product = "iPhone";

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select customers.acctnum
    from customers
        join febsales
            where customers.order_id = febsales.orderID;
            
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product
    from jansales
        where price in (select min(price) from jansales);

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
select product, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
    from jansales
        group by product;
        
--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, sum(quantity) as Total_Quantity, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
    from febsales
        where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
        group by product;
        
--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
    from febsales feb
        join customers cust
            on feb.orderid = cust.order_id
                where feb.quantity > 2;
